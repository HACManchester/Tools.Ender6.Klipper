# TODO

## X Endstop

I think the X Endstop has been configured for sensorless
check the klipper config

## Hotend

Hotend is a bit of a mystery, might be using a CAN bus adapter

## Debian Update

Ideally need to update debian from bullseye to bookworm
This will need a usb keyboard and access to the pi's usb underneath

## Shutdown

Currently the shutdown button is missing on klipperscreen to cleanly shutdown the pi

## Updates

Need to check on compiling klipper for the different control boards / hardware
and add in any plugins from my own setup

## Door Bracket

Door bracket needs reprinting, apparantly there is an issue with these easily breaking

## Calibration

Once everything is updated add in some calibration steps from my own setup
